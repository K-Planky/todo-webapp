# Creates the least-privilege role the application connects as.
#
# Why two roles at all: the postgres image makes POSTGRES_USER a cluster SUPERUSER, and a
# superuser can COPY ... TO PROGRAM (command execution in the database container) and read files
# with pg_read_file. Handing that credential to the internet-facing process means any future SQL
# injection escalates straight past the data. The app role below can do neither.
#
# Why POSTGRES_USER stays a superuser rather than being demoted: the nightly backup runs
# `pg_dumpall -U $POSTGRES_USER`, and pg_dumpall reads pg_authid to dump roles, which requires
# superuser. Demoting it produces a failing or degraded backup that you discover at restore time.
# So the admin role keeps its privileges and simply stops being the one the app uses.
#
# This runs ONCE, on first initialization of the data directory. For a database that already
# exists, see "Retrofitting an existing app" in DEPLOY.md.
